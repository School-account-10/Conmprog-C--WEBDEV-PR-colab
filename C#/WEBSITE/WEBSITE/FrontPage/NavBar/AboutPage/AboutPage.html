        <p>About EasyMed

EasyMed is a digital health platform designed to make reliable medical information accessible, understandable, and practical for everyone—especially students and individuals with limited access to healthcare resources. Developed as part of an academic research project at STI College Las Piñas, EasyMed aims to improve health literacy through technology.

In today’s world, where misinformation and barriers to healthcare are common, EasyMed provides a trusted source of evidence-based health information gathered from credible organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and other government health agencies. It helps users identify possible symptoms, understand their meaning, and take informed steps toward proper medical consultation and preventive care.

EasyMed functions as a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) — a tool that analyzes symptoms and health data to offer clear, data-driven recommendations. While it does not replace professional diagnosis, it serves as an educational and awareness tool that guides users in making responsible health choices.</p>
